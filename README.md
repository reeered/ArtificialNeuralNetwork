# Artificial Neural Network

## Introduction

This project implements a artificial neural network from scratch and compares it with models from scikit-learn. The neural network is implemented using only numpy and is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.

## Quick Start

This project provide a demo of the neural network implementation with diabetes dataset. To run the demo, execute the following command:

```sh
python demo.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the required packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
ArtificialNeuralNetwork/
├── ann/                    # Neural network implementation
├── README.md               # This file
├── requirements.txt        # Required packages
└── demo.py                 # Demo of project
```
